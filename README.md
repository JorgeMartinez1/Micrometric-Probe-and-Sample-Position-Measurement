# [Micrometric Probe and Sample Position Measurement]

## Description
[Your Project Name] is a software project designed for 3D reconstruction with a graphical user interface. When executed through the `main.py` file, the project deploys seamlessly, offering a straightforward user experience.

## Usage
- The primary control interface currently features only the 3D reconstruction method (button) enabled. To access other methods, please contact the project maintainer.

## Simulation Mode
- To initiate the process in simulation mode, select the left and right videos accordingly.

## Folder Structure
- The `outputs` folder must contain necessary inputs for reconstruction, along with example videos. The results of the process will be stored in the same directory.

## System Requirements
- Full support for macOS is currently under development.

## Disclaimer
- The software is shared exclusively for academic purposes. It is emphasized that the project is still in development, and any use for purposes other than its intended design is the responsibility of the user.
